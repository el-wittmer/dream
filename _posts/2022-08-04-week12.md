## Objectives
- Submit my final report!
  - My final report is finished and can be found [here](files/finalreport.pdf). I'm pleased with how the project turned out and think there's opportunity to expand on my results in the future and potentially create a manuscript out of it. It's been a very intense but rewarding project to take on, and I hope to be able to develop it more over the fall semester. 
 
- One last figure
  - This was a shortened and writing-intensive week so I don't have much to report. However, I did make this figure this week, which compares citations counts of Paul et al. (1963) to Kannel et al. (1964), two highly cited papers published around the same time, both focused on coronary heart disease research. This figure shows that both papers were receiving citations over the course of twenty years (which is somewhat unusual, but not unheard of) with a sharp decline in citations received in 1984.

(1964). The two show similar trends of publication, but with Kannel et al. (1964) receiving fewer citations. Both were receiving citations up to twenty years post-publication with a sharp decline in citation counts in 1984.">
